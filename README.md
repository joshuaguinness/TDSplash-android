# TDSplash-android

Android app built for my high school by my friends and I in the last couple weeks of grade 12 computer science. I was responsible for
writing the code to create buttons that when pressed would open up a webpage to the website they were looking for. Was currently working 
on a recycler view for news/calender items when the term ended.
